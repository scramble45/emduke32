### About
emduke32 aims to bring duke3d to your web browser by combining eduke32 with emscripten.
It does so by adding emscripten support to the eduke32 makefile system with minimal soure code modifications.

Feel free to reuse and contribute, pull requests are very welcome!
This code is (and forever will be) a work in progress.

```
make
```
To build the normal eduke32 binary with clang run:
```
make CLANG=1
```

```

```
You can load the html file with a webserver, for instance darkhttpd.
